### About me:
I am a Cyber Security Analyst focusing on penetration-testing of applications, networks, and infrastructures. I am also experienced in working as a BI Analyst as well, with knowledge in SQL and PowerBI. To top up, I am interested in expanding my expertise in the penetration-testing area, focusing on obtaining certificates such as Certified Ethical Hacker. <br/>

- 🔭 I’m currently organizing and managing PCI DSS penetration-tests, and leading the vulnerability management side as well.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other pen-testing enthusiasts and people from the Cyber Security field.
- 💬 Ask me anything about the current (physical and cyber) regional security state of affairs.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Mr. Robot TV series made me do this.


### 🌱 Hobbies that I’m currently challenging myself:
Since I do want to be an expepert in the security field and become a certified pen-tester, I decided to take more time focusing on feeding more knowledge to myself. As such, I set a couple of self-challenges in order to push myself more further.

* Learn to pen-test in Kali Linux (plus Nmap, Wireshark and Burp Suite) :man_technologist: 1-2 hours a day with no distraction.
* Read :newspaper: and be always up-to-date with what is happening in the current war, and not only. 
* Workout:weight_lifting_man: by going to the gym at least 3 times a week, for a healthy body.  
* Avoid spending too much time on TikTok or Youtube :skull_and_crossbones:.
